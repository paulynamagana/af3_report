## AlphaFold Results Visualization and Analysis

This repository provides tools to facilitate the visualisation and analysis of protein structure predictions generated by AlphaFold Server.  It offers both a Google Colab notebook and standalone scripts for local execution.

Features:

Streamlined updating of AlphaFold zip files.
Generation of insightful plots from prediction results, including:
Predicted Aligned Error (PAE)
Predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT)
Inter-chain Predicted TM-score (ipTM)
Predicted TM-score (pTM)
Contact Probabilities


### Google Colab:

1. Open the Google Colab notebook.
2. vUpload your AlphaFold zip file.
3. Run the provided code.

### Local Execution:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (see requirements.txt).
3. Run the scripts from your terminal using the following command format:

`python script_name.py folder_path [--output output_path]`

Replace script_name.py with the name of the script you want to run (e.g., pae_plots.py) and folder_path with the path to the folder containing your AlphaFold results. The optional --output argument allows you to specify a different output directory for the generated plots.

### Key Metrics Explained:

* pLDDT: Per-atom confidence score (0-100). Higher is better.
* PAE: Expected error in relative positions of residues. Lower is better.
* pTM: Accuracy of overall structure.
* ipTM: Precision of inter-chain interactions.
*Note*: These metrics are calculated for "tokens", which encompass standard amino acids, small molecules, and chemically modified residues.
